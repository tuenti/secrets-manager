## v1.0.2-rc.1 2019-09-30

### Fixes
- [#38 add the ability to watch secretDefinitions scoped to a particular namespace](https://github.com/tuenti/secrets-manager/issues/38)

## v1.0.1 2019-08-14
### Fixes
- Deleting a `SecretDefinition` hangs if the corresponding secret does not exist.
- Invalid metric names in README

### Deprecates
- Unused prometheus metrics `secrets_manager_controller_update_secret_errors_total` and `secrets_manager_controller_last_updated`

## v1.0.0 2019-07-29
Stable release

## v1.0.0-rc.1 2019-07-12
Release Candidate 1
## v1.0.0-snapshot-1 2019-07-09

### Added
- `SecretDefinitions` created via `CustomResourceDefinitions`
- If the `SecretDefinion` gets deleted, the corresponding secret will be removed too.
- New zap logger based on [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) project. Use `-enable-debug-log` to get a more verbose output.
### Fixes
- [#2 Switch to custom resource definitions instead of a single configmap](https://github.com/tuenti/secrets-manager/issues/2)
- [#8 Secrets deletion proposal](https://github.com/tuenti/secrets-manager/issues/8)

### Breaking changes
- congimaps won't be supported to define secrets, and so that won't work all the relevant configmap flags.
- log.format and log.level flags won't work anymore, as we have changed the logger to addapt to the [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) project. Use `-enable-debug-log` to get a more verbose output.
- `config.backend-scrape-interval` no longer works as we check the backend state on every reconcile event. Use `reconcile-period` instead
- `listen-address` removed in favor of `metrics-addr`

## v1.0.0-snapshot 2019-05-22

### Added
- Enable Vault AppRole auth method and `secrets-manager` will try to re-login every time it fails to fetch the token. This will make `secrets-manager` more resilient to issues connecting to Vault that potentially caused the token to expire.
- New `secrets_manager_login_errors_total` Prometheus metric.

### Fixes
- [#27-Implement AppRole auth](https://github.com/tuenti/secrets-manager/issues/27)

### Breaking changes
- Token based login won't be supported, as re-login with and invalid token won't make `secrets-manager` to self-heal.
- This makes this new version not backward compatible with previous v0.2.0

## v0.2.0 - 2019-03-29

Stable
## v0.2.0-rc.2 - 2019-01-29

### Added
- New `secrets_manager_vault_max_token_ttl` metric, so a user could alert based on this and `secrets_manager_token_ttl`
- New `secrets_manager_secret_last_sync_status` metric, that shows wether the secret succeded or not in last synchronization iteration

### Fixed
- Backend timeout not properly set through flags
- Deprecates `secrets_manager_vault_token_expired` metric as it was quite confusing since it's not really possible for `secrets-manager` to know when the token it's expired, just when it's "close to expire".
- Renames counter metrics to follow the Prometheus naming standard with the `_total` suffix instead of `_count`.
- Simplifies prometheus token renewal metrics by merging `secrets_manager_vault_token_lookup_errors_count` and `secrets_manager_vault_token_renew_errors_count` into one single metric `secrets_manager_vault_token_renewal_errors_total` with one more dimension called `vault_operation` which will be one of `lookup-self, renew-self, is-renewable`.

## v0.2.0-rc.1 - 2019-01-21

### Added
- Enable prometheus metrics
- `cfg.backend-timeout` flag to specify a connection timeout to the secrets backend.
- `listen-address` flag to specify the listen address of the HTTP API

### Fixed
- Bad return condition in startTokenRenewer, so token lookup won't
  happen in case of a token revoked.
